# Style Guide

This project uses a cinematic athletic look: dark, moody gradients, glass-like panels, and warm neon accents. The visual goal is to feel premium, energetic, and data-driven without looking like a generic dashboard.

## Visual Description
- Mood: Midnight training room with neon glow and metallic surfaces.
- Backgrounds: Large radial gradients on the page with subtle color blooms.
- Surfaces: Semi-transparent glass panels with soft borders and blur.
- Typography: A serif headline paired with a geometric sans for body and controls.
- Data visuals: Clean, bold charts with high contrast and minimal clutter.
- Motion: Subtle rise-in animation on cards, no excessive micro-animations.

## Typography
- Headings: Playfair Display or Fraunces (serif) for hero and panel titles.
- Body: Sora or Space Grotesk (geometric sans) for UI text.
- Letter spacing: Slightly increased in uppercase kicker labels.

## Color System
Core palette (CSS variables in pages like stats and leaderboard):
- Background: #0b0f1c to #0b132b (night gradients)
- Text: #f8fafc (fog)
- Accents: 
  - Sun: #f59e0b
  - Sea: #0ea5e9
  - Mint: #34d399
  - Blush: #fb7185
- Glass panel: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)
- Border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18)

## Layout + Spacing
- Hero sections have large padding and a headline + controls side by side.
- Panels use 20-24px border radius and 1.5rem internal padding.
- Grid sections collapse to a single column at 768px.

## Component Patterns
- Period tabs and metric toggles use pill buttons with gradient fill on active.
- KPI cards are glass panels with bold numeric emphasis.
- Tables are dark, minimal, and keep high contrast for readability.

## Charts
- Chart.js defaults with custom colors and stacked horizontal bars.
- Category colors are generated by HSL for consistent contrast.
- Line charts use smooth tension and soft fills.

## Motion
- Cards rise in using a simple keyframe (fade + translateY).
- No heavy transitions on data changes; keep snappy.

## Responsive Rules
- Breakpoint: 768px
- Reduce padding in hero and main sections.
- Smaller text size for tabs and tables.
- Controls stack vertically and stretch to full width.

## Technical Notes
- Use CSS variables for palette and transparency.
- Shared base tokens and primitives live in `static/css/theme.css`.
- Use `color-scheme: dark` on selects to keep dropdowns readable.
- Prefer `minmax(0, 1fr)` grid columns to avoid overflow on small screens.
- Use `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` for glass effect (safe to ignore if unsupported).
